# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The provided code lacks proper mechanisms to gracefully handle database errors or invalid input, which can lead to information leaks or application crashes.

The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code attempts to fetch user data from a database based on a user ID from the request parameters. However, it fails to handle potential errors during the database operation or invalid user IDs. This can lead to:

* **Information Leaks:** If a database error occurs, the error message might reveal sensitive information about the database structure or internal workings to the client.
* **Unexpected Behavior:**  Unhandled exceptions can lead to the application crashing or returning unexpected responses to the client.

## Solution

The solution implements proper error handling to address these issues:

* **Input Validation:** Checks that the userId is valid before attempting to access the database.
* **Database Error Handling:**  Catches and handles potential errors gracefully, returning appropriate error responses to the client without leaking sensitive information.
* **Clear Error Messages:** Provides descriptive error messages to the client without exposing internal details.

This example uses a placeholder `db.getUser` function to simulate database interaction.  Replace it with your actual database interaction logic.
